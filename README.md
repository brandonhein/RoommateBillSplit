Roommate Bill Split... minimize the number of money transactions
This program runs off the assumption that roommates paid their unique bill (or will).  
In theroy it makes sense.  If you paid the biggest bill for the month, you're roommates should pay you back.  
Not have you pay them only for them to give you it back plus some.
