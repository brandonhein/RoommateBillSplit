Roommate Bill Split... minimize the number of money transactions
Giving this hobby a go. This C# program runs off the assumption that roommates paid their unique bill (or will).  
Later Verisons will start to incorp functions and other uses rather than just events.
In theroy it makes sense (as we did this for my roommates back in college.  If you paid the biggest bill for the month, you're roommates should pay you back.  
Not have you pay them only for them to give you it back plus some.
